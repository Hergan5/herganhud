HerganHUD
=========


A simple and clean Team Fortress 2 HUD based off yahud FLV(BLU).

Description
===========


Something I spend a 2 weeks or so, tried to make it as clean as possible, it includes a 6v6 and 16v16 scoreboard.
You can easily customize it by changing colors in clientscheme.res and renaming extra files in resource/ui.

Installation
============


This is a easy one. Go to your Steam directory (it's in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\ by default) and open steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom
and put the herganhud-master folder you get in a zip there, to get there faster, right click on TF2 in Steam Library, go to Local Files tab
and press Browse Local Files, then you can go to tf/custom.

To-Do
=========


- Redo MvM HUD
